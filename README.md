# cards
A simulation for playing cards and the market for purchasing

### Card game
This is a card game inspired heavily from Magic the Gathering. This has roughly similar rules and terminology but is simplified to cater the needs of this game. The purpose of creating actual "game" is to create an AI to choose good decks to fight other AIs. This then creates desireability of a card to be chosen to a deck.

### Market simulationi
The idea is to run multiple games along with market simulation. The market is similar to stock market and relies on the values of the cards. Many things affect the value: effectiveness in game play, the rarity of the card, the printing, artist, etc.
